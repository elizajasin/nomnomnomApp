    <string name="darkIng">1/2 cup brown sugar
        \n2 Tablespoons honey
        \n2 Tablespoons peanut butter
        \n1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        \n2 Tablespoons butter
        \n1/4 teaspoon salt
        \n2 cups Old-Fashioned oats
        \n1/4 cup dark chocolate chips
        \n1 teaspoon cinnamon</string>
    <string name="darkHow">Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13x9 pan (with aluminum foil) with cooking or baking spray. OR use parchment paper. In a bowl mix oatmeal, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside. In a small pot on LOW heat melt brown sugar, peanut butter, butter, honey and vanilla and continuously stir until well combined. Be careful not to burn sugar. Once properly mixed, add to oatmeal mixture. Use a spatula if necessary, you want to get all of the wet ingredients incorporated. Once mixed well with oatmeal mixture, add dark chocolate chips and fold in. (At this time add optional ingredients if necessary.) Pour mixture in pan. Pat down and spread evenly. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until it has browned nicely. If you want bars, cut with a pizza cutter immediately after removal from oven, as the granola should have a minimum of 25 minutes to set. After the granola has cooled, remove it from the pan and break it into clusters. Enjoy!</string>
