    <string name="darkHow">\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees F.
        \n\nSpray a 13x9 pan (with aluminum foil) with cooking or baking spray. OR use parchment paper.
        \n\nIn a bowl mix oatmeal, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.
        \n\nIn a small pot on LOW heat melt brown sugar, peanut butter, butter, honey and vanilla and continuously stir until well combined. Be careful not to burn sugar.
        \n\nOnce properly mixed, add to oatmeal mixture. Use a spatula if necessary, you want to get all of the wet ingredients incorporated.
        \n\nOnce mixed well with oatmeal mixture, add dark chocolate chips and fold in. (At this time add optional ingredients if necessary.)
        \n\nPour mixture in pan. Pat down and spread evenly.
        \n\nBake for 15-20 minutes or until it has browned nicely.
        \n\nIf you want bars, cut with a pizza cutter immediately after removal from oven, as the granola should have a minimum of 25 minutes to set.
        \n\nAfter the granola has cooled, remove it from the pan and break it into clusters. Enjoy!</string>
